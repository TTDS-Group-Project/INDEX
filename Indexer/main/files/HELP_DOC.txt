main() - will run when deployed

Has a ready made kafka consumer:
    If broker not available check:
        1. correct IP
        2. It is up and running
        3. wifi
        4. Other its is a very general problem


Will run but will exit in an exception -> hence may need way around or an alert set-up?

Main processing is bk.jproc -> returns the already chunky
in-memory storage items perhaps better as objects
?

Check 10000 as a flush
